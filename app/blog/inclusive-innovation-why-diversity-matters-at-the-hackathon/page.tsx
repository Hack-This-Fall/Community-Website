                <p>
                  We all are well aware of the literal definition of what a
                  hackathon is, but what exactly a hackathon is...A hackathon is
                  a space where our crazy ideas shape into reality! Just imagine
                  sitting in a place full of like-minded folks, brainstorming
                  with a team, hacking for prolonged hours, testing and
                  deploying, networking and making connections, building
                  projects and much more. A space that comes with inclusive
                  innovation drives an individual or teams to work together
                  towards achieving collaborative goals. A space where hacks
                  don&apos;t remain hacks but turn into mind-blowing projects or
                  startup ideas.
                </p>
                <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">Diversity & Innovation</p>
                <p>
                  Innovation is driven by collaboration, imagination, creativity
                  and differing qualities or diversity that provide novel
                  solutions to meaningful problems. Inclusive innovation is a
                  concept that combines these fundamentals and creates space
                  where individuals irrespective of their background come
                  together to learn and grow. As said, diversity fuels
                  creativity and innovation but diversity isnâ€™t a tick box or
                  check box exercise. It requires a commitment to bring change
                  and live in an all-inclusive environment. One of the best
                  examples of this is the technical communities and hackathons
                  that aim to foster an inclusive environment where people of
                  diverse backgrounds, genders, and cultures can collaborate and
                  innovate for good. These communities are spaces with zero
                  tolerance for discrimination or other exclusionary behavior.
                  They value diversity and acknowledge unique, diverse
                  perspectives leading to revolutionary ideas.

                <p className="text-2xl font-semibold">Why diversity matters!</p>
                <p>
                  Hackathons are events that promote teamwork, creativity and
                  problem-solving. In recent years hackathons have evolved in
                  such a way that geographical boundaries do not limit
                  inclusiveness. There are offline and online spaces where
                  programmers, coders and tech enthusiasts convene to share
                  knowledge, build solutions and inspire one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hackathon is an excellent way of collaborating for the greater
                  good and that is why diversity and inclusivity play a major
                  role in hackathons in its many aspects to construct to a true
                  hackathon experience.

                <p>
                  A hackathon is a competitive event where individuals/teams
                  together develop solutions. Learning is a 2-way street. One
                  can seek guidance from experienced and in return can share
                  their perspectives or ideas.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Diverse teams bring diverse perspectives, experiences and
                  backgrounds as team members approach problems and tasks from
                  various angles. This in turn leads to comprehensive and
                  thoughtful decisions to solve the problem.

                <p className="text-xl font-semibold">Better Adaptability</p>
                <p>
                  When put in situations of extreme pressure and stress diverse
                  teams often adapt to such rapid change in the environment as
                  there are people in the team who have different skills that
                  benefit the team and make the difference.

                <p>
                  Navigating the complexity of coding or project building
                  becomes a comparatively easier process when seasoned
                  developers act as guides. There are mentors who offer all the
                  required support to those just starting their journey.

                  Acknowledging and celebrating achievements also gives a sense
                  of belongingness. At hackathons, one gets to network and
                  collaborate with like-minded folks and share stories of shared
                  struggles. A spirit of technical expertise and inclusive
                  innovation is shared.

                <p>
                  Success here is not about having coding skills or winning the
                  hackathon but about together building a welcoming environment
                  fostering equal participation. It is about committing to
                  Inclusive innovation. Matrix for success go beyond lines of
                  code and are scaled upon lives touched and problems solved for
                  a social cause or greater good.

                  Inclusive innovation is not limited to coding in hackathons.
                  It has to expand its horizons for advances in all aspects, be
                  it technical or real-life problem-solving. Evidently, it is a
                  task to address challenges that obstruct the inclusive
                  environment and fostering of diverse perspectives but that is
                  what Inclusive Innovation is all about, where everyone is
                  sitting at the table and innovating for Good.
