                Actionable Steps to Leverage Hackathons for Career Growth
              </p>
              <div className="text-lg">
                Through conversations with participants, organizers, and judges,
                clear patterns have emerged among those whoâ€™ve successfully used
                hackathons to boost their careers. Here are some actionable tips
                to help you make the most of your hackathon experience:
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>
                    <span className="font-semibold">
                      Choose Your Team Wisely:
                    </span>{" "}
                    Donâ€™t just team up with friends for funâ€”surround yourself
                    with motivated individuals who are there to learn and build
                    something impactful. Working with like-minded, driven people
                    enhances your experience and pushes you to perform better.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span className="font-semibold">
                      Step Out of Your Comfort Zone:
                    </span>{" "}
                    Hackathons attract people from diverse backgrounds and
                    industries. Take the opportunity to network beyond your
                    usual circleâ€”you never know if the next person you meet
                    works at a top tech company, a startup, or could be your
                    future co-founder. These connections could lead to
                    unexpected career opportunities.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                      Build Genuine Relationships:
                    </span>{" "}
                    Hackathons are more than a place to collect LinkedIn
                    connections. Invest time in getting to know people and
                    maintaining regular communication after the event. Many
                    hackathons have their own Discord serversâ€”introduce yourself
                    there and engage with others. These communities often thrive
                    long after the event is over.

                  <li>
                    <span className="font-semibold">Engage with Sponsors:</span>{" "}
                    Use the technology stacks provided by sponsoring companies
                    and interact with their representatives. Share your
                    excitement about your project and how their product helped
                    you. This creates a lasting impression, which can lead to
                    future opportunities.

                    Hackathon organizers have a wealth of experience, often
                    having leveraged hackathons to advance their own careers.
                    Take the time to talk to them, learn from their experiences,
                    and seek advice.

                    Once youâ€™ve built a strong GitHub portfolio and polished
                    your resume, donâ€™t hesitate to ask for referrals. If youâ€™ve
                    demonstrated your skills and passion during the hackathon,
                    many professionals will be happy to help connect you with
                    job opportunities.

              <p className="text-lg">
                Hackathons are not just about building projects under
                pressureâ€”theyâ€™re a gateway to learning new skills, forming
                meaningful connections, and unlocking career opportunities. By
                actively participating and taking ownership of your hackathon
                experience, you can transform your career trajectoryâ€”no matter
                what stage youâ€™re at. You never know who might be watching or
                where your newfound skills might lead.
