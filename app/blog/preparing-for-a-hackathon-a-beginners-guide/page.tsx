                Ah, hackathons! Those magical events where coffee fuels
                creativity, code feels like a second language, and sleep becomes
                a distant memory. If you're a beginner, the thought of jumping
                into one might feel like being asked to perform brain surgery
                with a spoon. But don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis guide is here to be your
                hackathon lifeline!

              <p className="text-lg">
                Hackathons come in all shapes and sizes. Some focus on social
                impact, others dive deep into emerging technologies like
                blockchain or AI, and a few are just about having fun and
                pushing boundaries (legally, of course). Start by finding one
                that aligns with your interests. Love artificial intelligence?
                Look for an AI-themed hackathon. Passionate about solving
                real-world problems? Opt for one focused on social impact.

              <p className="text-lg">
                Hackathons are way more fun with a team. You can join with
                friends or meet new people at the event. Some hackathons even
                allow solo participation‚Äîso you can be the lone warrior
                building, debugging, and shipping your project all by yourself.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Pro tip: Build a team with diverse skills. If you‚Äôre a
                developer, partner up with a designer, a backend engineer, or
                even a writer. A well-rounded team will help you create a more
                polished and complete project.

                The best hackathon projects solve real problems‚Äîwhether for
                businesses, communities, or just your average person struggling
                with Wi-Fi during important meetings. Before you dive in, take a

                Most hackathons have a theme, so start by understanding it. Once

                creative solutions that are both unique and impactful.

                Hackathons can last anywhere from 12 hours to an entire weekend,

                At hackathons, everything will break‚Äîyour code, your logic, and

                process. It‚Äôs what makes hackathons such incredible learning
