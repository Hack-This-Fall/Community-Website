                Hack This Fall began with a mindset of encouraging new hackers
                to build unique projects regardless of the tech or field; the
                only focus was to create something meaningful and enjoy building
                while also solving the shared struggles of our surroundings.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                We hosted our first edition in 2020 which was an experiment as
                we were organizing a hackathon for the first time and it turned
                out to be a successful event. We received a great response from
                our community as we were joined by 500+ hackers from 170+
                cities, who all ended up building 50+ projects. It was one of
                the first digital hackathons in the region during COVID times.
                To continue our mission and match the expectations of our
                community after season 1, we decided to start planning another
                edition.

              <p className="text-lg">
                Hack This Fall Season 2 was meant to exceed the digital
                hackathon experiences for our hacker community members and guess
                what, it went over the top. It was a 48 Hours Virtual Hackathon
                organized on Oct 22nd - Oct 24th, 2021. The hackathon
                experienced an outstanding attendance of 4500+ hackers joining
                us from 55+ countries across the globe which all ended up
                showcasing 320+ amazing ideas and project submissions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Hack This Fall became an MLH member event, which means that
                Major League Hacking verified us as a high-quality event by
                evaluating the event‚Äôs progress in key areas such as
                sponsorship, marketing, and logistics. We also introduced our
                all-new tagline ‚ÄúInnovate For Good‚Äù. Hackers truly understood
                the value of our motto and showed their excellent piece of
                innovation and problem-solving skills.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Apart from having a great time hacking, our community got an
                opportunity to collaborate in so many meaningful ways. We use to
                have #HTFConnect hacker hangouts every week on our discord where
                we use to discuss various topics, share each other‚Äôs experiences
                and learn together. Such hacker connects, drives various
                valuable conversations which eventually helped our hackers to
                get more aware and understand things they didn‚Äôt know before.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg">
                One of the great things about Hack This Fall was its pre-event
                workshops, we ran over 45+ sessions on our Youtube on multiple
                domains and topics which could ultimately help hackers learn new
                technologies, build great ideas and share their solutions with
                the rest of the community. We covered subjects like Jamstack,
                Containers, Authentication, Blockchain, Azure, and so much more.
                With this, we wanted our hackers to be aware of all these before
                actually starting with the hackathon. And having these workshops
                way before the hackathon allowed them to give it some time and
                grasp it.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Hackers also had a lot of fun time participating in super cool
                mini-events we scheduled for them. This way, hackers get to take
                some time off from hacking and relax their minds to enjoy and
                have some chill. We did Hacker Hangouts to interact with other
                hackers participating, we also ran an MS Paint mini-event, where
                we followed along with Bob Ross himself. MLH ran a special
                Werewolf mini-event which was again an awesome one and lastly,
                we played Sketchful mini-event to draw and guess the same!
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                This year, we also initiated a new program named Hack This Fall
                Hackathon Evangelist. Evangelists are extended Hack This Fall
                team members who are passionate about Hackathons and
                Communities. These are the folks who actively spread awareness
                and encourage people to get involved in the hackathon space.
                Being a Hackathon Evangelist means that one is committed to
                bringing a change in their surrounding by helping others and
                contributing in a meaningful way. We onboarded over 100+
                Evangelists and helped them add value to the community.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg">
                We encourage Inclusion and Diversity at the core of our
                community core and have various activities around the same to
                keep hackers engaged in a meaningful way. All in all, we wanted
                our hackers to not just participate but experience a hackathon
                in a true sense. And we managed to do that quite well. Hack This
                Fall is known for its experience and we want to make sure that
                people participate in a hackathon not just to win but to
                upskill, network, learn, build and share.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg">
                Lastly, would just want to conclude by mentioning that, Season 2
                was such a blast and it leveled up the true hackathon digital
                experience for the hackers in the region. A huge shoutout to all
                the humans involved in making it memorable. We couldn‚Äôt have
                pulled it off so smoothly without the support from all our
                sponsors, thanks to each of them.
              </p>

                I can‚Äôt thank enough my outstanding team who selflessly worked
                together and brought the idea of running a successful digital
                hackathon to life. With that being said, please take a sip of
                chilled coke with a slice of a pizza while we prepare for you an
                all-new edition. Get ready to go Above & Beyond this year as we
                bring to you Hack This Fall 3.0 and that too in person! Head
